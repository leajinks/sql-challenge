Bootcamp Module 9 Homework

This repository includes files needed to create a SQL database of employee information and perform various queries on that information. CSV files with 
employee data are located in the Resources folder. The text in the table_schemas file should be ran in a query tool to create tables for all of the
information in the CSV's, then the CSV's can be imported into the tables in the order in which they are created in table_schemas (importing them
in a different order may cause errors). The employee_queries file includes queries that can be run to compile different sets of data from the tables.
